### Gameplay

- Grid based map subdivided into rooms
- Each map has a set of suspects
- One of the rooms has a body or clues to the body's disappearance (eg: bloodstains)
- One of the suspects is the murderer
- Suspects can be questioned ('q') to reveal their alibis
- Rooms can be searched for clues ('s') to reveal items or features of interest
- Items can be picked up to assist with the investigation

Unsure about these:

- Rogue style combat (following Sherlock Holmes, using revolvers and riding crops)
- Role playing stats for investigation (see Gumshoe system for tabletop games)
- Permadeath? Saved characters? Or start from scratch each level?
- Is money required to travel between scenes?

### Engine

- Turn based
- Command/action based input
- NPCs behave differently depending on their anxiety level and alibis
- Standard A* chase algorithm once the murderer decides to attack the player
- Randomly generated story scenarios: suspects, rooms, items, murder weapon and motive
- Text based story log
